     * <h1>Stack</h1>
     * <p>Stack class extends the Vector class</p>
     * <p>
     *     <strong>In stack, elements are stored and accessed in Last In First Out manner. <br>
     *     This means elements are added to the top of the stack and removed from the top of the stack.
     *     </strong>
     * </p>
     * <h3>Stack Methods:</h3>
     * <ul>
     *     <li>
     *         <strong>push()</strong>, is used to add an element to the top of the stack. The argument we pass to the method
     *         when its invoked is the element we want to add
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         <strong>pop()</strong>, is used to remove an element form the top of the stack.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         <strong>peek()</strong>, is used to return an object from the top of the stack.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         <strong>search()</strong>, is used to search an element in the stack. It returns the index of the element  we pass as an argument
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         <strong>empty()</strong>, is used to check if whether a stack is empty it returns a boolean value.
     *         <br>
     *         <small>
     *             <strong>It is recommended to use the ArrayDeque instead of the Stack.</strong>
     *         </small>
     *     </li>
     * </ul>
